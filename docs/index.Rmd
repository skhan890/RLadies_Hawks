# May 2019 


Step back to May 2019. Invited as the **R Ladies of Atlanta** guest speaker for the Atlanta Hawks.

# What is the **R Ladies of Atlanta** group?

![https://rladies.org/](pics/rladies.png)


*Mission statement:* The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users (see recent stats).

As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladiesâ€™ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.

# The dashboard


https://skhan22.shinyapps.io/RLadies_Hawks/ 


Made using R Shiny

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "400px"}

knitr::include_graphics("pics/shiny-logo.png")

```


---

# What is in the dashboard?

--

- Extensible tool to compare standardized PERs across years and seasons contributed by players, regardless of years played or team (or gender-structured organization)

<br>

--

- To analyze WNBA player scores with those in the NBA

<br>

--

- To look at long career vs short career players

<br>

---

# The data:

Uses **Player Efficency Ratings** (PERs) 

--

What are PERs?

--

**PERs**: average contribution of a player for each season
**Data source**: https://www.basketball-reference.com/

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "400px"}

knitr::include_graphics("pics/capture-dash.png")

```



---

# What motivated incorporating WNBA?


--

1. RLadies!


![https://rladies.org/](pics/rladies.png)

--

##**2. Not a lot of data on WNBA available online**

- Had to manually scrape each data point (friend of a friend had done this previously) from _Wikipedia_

- Lack of data analysis on WNBA

--

- Surprisingly, no comparison of PERs between NBA and WNBA players available online

---

# Differences between NBA and WNBA

--

<center>$$$$</center>

--


- NBA **October - April** (7 months), 81 games

- WNBA in season from **May - October** (4 months), 34 games

--


- To supplement, WNBA players will play overseas for 8 months

```


- R package that lets you create interactive web applications

- Integrates into R

- Hosts on an RShiny Server
  - Can host on your own
  - Or use shinyapps.io

- All free 

---

# What do you need to build a Shiny app?

--

- Latest version of R installed

--

- Latest version of RStudio

--

- Install the "shiny" package, like below

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
install.packages("shiny")
```

--

- Make a folder

--

  + Make a script called *ui.R*

--

  + Make a script called *server.R*

---

# ui.R

```{r, eval = F}
library(shiny)

shinyUI(fluidPage(
      
      # Enter the title of your app
      titlePanel(),
      
      # side bar has 2 components
       sidebarLayout(
      
         #1. Side bar panel
          sidebarPanel(),
      
         #2. Main Panel
           mainPanel()
                    )
                  )
       )

```

---

# server.R


```{r, eval = F}
library(shiny)

shinyServer(

function(input, output){

  # fancy stuff goes here
                       }
)

```
